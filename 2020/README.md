Please add your ideas for new questions, as well as tell us which questions from 2019 we should keep in the 2020 survey.


### Suggestions
* What is the staffing count for respondents' OSPO? @ashleywolf wants bencharks by industry and # of employees.
* Do you know what an OSPO is, and/or how familiar are you with the term? This would include a definition. Asksed at TODO Group meeting. 
** LH's note: We originally didn't include a definition so we didn't bias the question about what a program's responsibilities are. 2) We know that among those that don't have plans for an open source program, only 21% said that it is because they were unfamiliar with the term. 
* Idea: Note at the beginning of survey saying we are trying to get one respondent per company, so don't forward to your friends
* Do you leverage open source for marketing/thought leadership purposes? (suggested by @gravax)
* Do you integrate open source participation into your societal responsibility activites? (suggested by @gravax)
