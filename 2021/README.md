* **OSPO Benefits and Responsibilities:** OSPOs had a positive impact on their sponsors’ software practices, but their benefits differed depending on the size of an organization.

* **Planning an OSPO:** Companies that intended to start an OSPO hoped it would increase innovation, but setting a strategy and a budget remained top challenges to their goals.

* **Organizations without an OSPO:** Almost half of survey participants without an OSPO believed it would help their company, but of those that didn’t think it would help, 35% said they haven’t even considered it.

* **Value of Open Source Participation:** 27% of survey participants said a company’s open source participation is at least very influential in their organization’s buying decisions.
