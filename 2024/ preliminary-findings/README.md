### About the Data

The final sample size for this dataset includes 222 respondents:

- 100 who currently have an OSPO,
- 26 planning to implement one, and
- 96 without an OSPO

### Additional Notes

- Among the 26 planning an OSPO, 77% intend to implement it within a year
- Organizations not currently having an OSPO cite specific reasons for this decision in Q46 and Q47
- The most significant segmentations are explored in Question 21. For detailed analysis, refer to slides 37-40 of the deck
- This year, there was a significant drop in participant responses compared to last year. We are still in the process of identifying the concrete reasons for this
- The final dataset, including the report with storytelling, filtering criteria CSV file, and raw data, will be published in this repo by November and presented at the Linux Foundation Member Summit
