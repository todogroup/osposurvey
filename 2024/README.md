## Key Findings

The State of OSPOs and Open Source Management 2024 report highlights the evolving role of OSPOs (Open Source Program Offices) and similar initiatives in driving the effective integration of open source management across diverse specializations and sectors, including security, AI infrastructure, and beyond. 

- 91% of OSPOs are involved in managing security issues. This shows the role OSPOs play in bridging security and open source management
- 84% of OSPOs are involved in managing GenAI infrastructure. OSPOs are becoming integral partners in digital transformation efforts, especially in the adoption and management of Generative AI (GenAI) technologies
- 80% of organizations report that their OSPOs have a meaningful impact on their ability to collaborate with open source communities
- 77% of large organizations have an OSPO, while only 19% of small organizations do. These figures reveal a gap not only in adoption rates but also in how the OSPO and dedicated satff involved in Open Source Management is used:

   - Larger organizations focus on leveraging their use of open source to mitigate risk, stay current with industry trends and practices, and align with broader policy objectives
   - Smaller organizations, on the other hand, prioritize developing an open source strategy, executing that strategy, and implementing processes and best practices to guide their efforts effectively
