The 2024 survey aims to generate insights into the following areas:

- Adoption and impact of OSPOs across sectors and industries, including perceived benefits and challenges of open source offices, and trends in hiring for open source development.
- The role of OSPOs in critical AI infrastructure, including how OSPOs enable open source knowledge, infrastructure within organizations, tools, and skilled people to contribute to the open source projects that power modern AI infrastructure.
- The role of OSPOs in the security and sustainability of open source ecosystems, including how OSPOs contribute to building more secure software within the software supply chain, and how they enable long-term sustainable ecosystems by aligning organizational goals with open source goals and engaging stakeholders, teams, and executives.
- Industry or geographical segmentation, including additional survey questions to gain insight into specific regions or industries (e.g., OSPOs in finance, OSPOs in Japan).
