1,,,Introduction,
,,,,
1,Text,,"INTRODUCTION:
The TODO Group and Linux Foundation Research are conducting a survey as part of a research project on the prevalence and outcomes of open source programs and similar open source initiatives operating across the globe. We are thankful for the support of Cisco, NGINX, InnerSource Commons, open source Initiative, and CHAOSS as advisors to and distributors of this survey. This survey should take no more than 15 minutes of your time.

GOALS:
By lending your insights and expertise, you'll not only contribute to the advancement of OSPO practices but also unlock invaluable support for your strategic initiatives. Results will provide nuanced guidelines tailored to different industry segments, ensuring that OSPOs receive actionable insights relevant to different organizations' unique challenges and opportunities. Your participation will enable us to gather comprehensive data that will shape the future of OSPO initiatives and pave the way for enhanced collaboration and innovation.

BONUS:
As a thank you for participating in this research, once you have completed the survey, a code will be displayed on the confirmation page that can be used for a 30% discount on any Linux Foundation training course or certification exam listed in our catalog (https://training.linuxfoundation.org/full-catalog/).

ADDED BONUS:
If you qualify for and complete this survey, Linux Foundation Research will also make a donation to the Linux Foundation’s Travel Fund. The Linux Foundation’s Travel Fund enables open source developers and community members to attend events that they would otherwise be unable to attend due to a lack of funding. Your participation in this survey will help others in our community!

VISIBILITY:
We will summarize the survey data and findings in a report to be published on the Linux Foundation website. The dataset for this survey will be posted and made publicly available in the Linux Foundation's section of Data.World.

PRIVACY:
Your name and/or organization name will not be displayed. Responses will be subject to the Linux Foundation’s Privacy Policy, available at https://linuxfoundation.org/privacy. Please note that research partners who are not Linux Foundation employees will review the survey results. Survey partners are not permitted to use your data for other purposes.",
